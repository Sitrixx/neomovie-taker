# THIS IS NEOMOVIE

"Neomovie" is an ambitious project developed within a tight timeframe of one week to gain entry into TAKER, an association of student workers at my school.

**_Neomovie aims to revolutionize the movie industry by providing a cutting-edge platform to rival Allocin√© (a popular French movie website), and requires a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to be developed promptly._**

The project required the implementation of various features outlined in the project brief provided in the file "My_AlloCine.pdf".

I'll now translate the content of this file for you :

- The home presentation section should explain the NeoMovie project, similar to the home presentation page of Netflix (https://www.netflix.com/fr/).

- On the login page, the user will be able to check a "remember me" box to avoid having to log in again for the next five minutes.

- Once the user authenticates, if it's their first login, the user will need to choose their preferred movie genre.

- Upon each subsequent login, the user should be redirected to the application page, where a list of movies in the genre chosen by the user during their first login will be displayed.

- On this same page, filters should be available (release year, genre, language).

- A search bar will allow users to search for movie titles, with the search updating with each typed letter.

- Clicking on a movie poster opens a new page where the trailer and details of the movie will be displayed (synopsis, title, genre, etc.).

- Users can like a movie and access their list of liked movies.

- Users can create playlists and add a movie to their playlist.

- Users can click on a "watched this movie" button and access their list of watched movies.

The project adheres to the main features and requirements outlined in the brief. However, there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of incorporating engaging animations and enhancing user experience. While I prioritized simplicity to achieve the MVP within the one-week timeframe, there are opportunities to further enhance the overall design and functionality.
